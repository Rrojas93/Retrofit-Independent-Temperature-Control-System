# Retrofit-Independent-Temperature-Control-System
Distributed Microcontrollers Capstone Course Project. 

These are the project files used for the Master Controller of the project. The project was managed manually without a source control system and logs were kept in "GROUP 2 README.docx" file. These set of files were the final iteration (version) of the project before demonstration. An additional pdf file is provided which combines all the code from all the files in one document.

Project Purpose: To allow users to set their preferred room temperature in their living space through a simple, retrofit, easy to install design.  

Description: The project was designed in 4 major subsystems as a distributed system (using multiple Raspberry Pi's). The four systems include the Master Control, Thermostats, Registers (vents), and Communications. In the Capstone course in which this project was built, the students split up into these four teams. I was part of the Master Control Group as the primary coder. The system was designed, built, and demonstrated successfully as a working implementation. The project was chosen to be displayed in the display case of the Engineering Building of the Kennesaw State University Marietta Campus for exemplorary work along with my Digital 3 project "Automated Pet Feeder" from a previous semester.
